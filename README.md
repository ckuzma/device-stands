    - Printing Notes
        - Print each part laid flat.  For extra rigidity, the two end pieces can be printed with 100% infill.  The connector spar may need some light sanding to properly fit into the other two peices, or it can be edited to have a smaller diameter and then printed.  Total print time for me was about 14 hours with 100% infill and default settings.
